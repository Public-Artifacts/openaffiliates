# Open Affiliates

## Affiliate rewards for referring smart contract transactions

Open Affiliates is a decentralized referral system designed to incentivize community-aligned growth in the web3 ecosystem. By leveraging the principles of web1 referral and affiliate programs, Open Affiliates allows dApps to reward community members who bring in new users, fostering a decentralized and community-driven approach to user acquisition and engagement.

It contains:
1. **A Rewards Pool**: dApps can maintain a rewards pool, which can be funded with ETH or any ERC-20 token. This pool serves as the source of rewards for successful referrals.
2. **Optional `referrer` Parameter**: The incentivized contract functions, such as deposit or mint, have an optional `referrer` parameter. This allows transactions to specify who referred them, enabling the system to reward the right entities.
3. **Self-Registration for Referrers**: Open Affiliates provides a mechanism for any Ethereum address to stake a defined amount of a token to register as a referrer. This stake acts as a commitment and can be slashed by the contract owner if the referrer is found to misuse the system.
4. **Automatic Rewards**: Registered referrers automatically receive rewards from the dedicated rewards pool when transactions specify their address in the `referrer` parameter.

This repo contains a simple implementation example for an ERC-4626 vault that wants to incentivize deposits using Open Affiliates. The example demonstrates how to set up a rewards pool, allow for referrer registration, and automatically distribute rewards based on incoming transactions with the `referrer` parameter.

```solidity
// Example of setting up a rewards pool
function fundReferralPool(uint256 amount) external {
    IERC20(rewardsToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    referralRewardsPool += amount;
}

// Example of a transaction with an optional referrer parameter
function depositWithReferrer(uint256 amount, address referrer) external {
    require(registeredReferrers[referrer], "Referrer not registered");
    vault.deposit(msg.sender, amount);
    uint256 reward = calculateReward(amount);
    referralRewardsPool -= reward;
    referrerRewards[referrer] += reward;
}

// Example of self-registration for referrers
function registerAsReferrer() external {
    registeredReferrers[msg.sender] = true;
}

// Example of automatic rewards distribution
function claimReward() external {
    uint256 amount = referrerRewards[msg.sender];
    require(amount > 0, "No rewards to claim");
    referrerRewards[msg.sender] = 0;
    IERC20(rewardsToken).transfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

One challenge with such systems is the potential for abuse, especially Sybil attacks where one entity can act as both referrer and end user. dApps that reward temporary or reversible actions (like deposits) should be aware of potential abuse. However, for permanent actions like mints and purchases, this shouldnâ€™t be an issue. Future implementations could incorporate additional safeguards to prevent rewards farming and other forms of abuse.
